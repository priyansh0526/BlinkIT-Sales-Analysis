🛒 BlinkIT Sales Analysis
📊 Project Overview

The BlinkIT Sales Analysis project focuses on understanding sales performance and customer purchasing behavior using Python and Power BI.
The project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing sales transaction data to derive actionable insights that help optimize business decisions such as inventory management, pricing, and customer segmentation.

🚀 Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Analyze sales patterns, item visibility, and outlet performance.

Create interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize trends and KPIs.

Provide insights to help improve sales strategies and operational efficiency.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (for data analysis and cleaning)

Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)

Power BI (interactive dashboard creation)

Jupyter Notebook (analysis environment)

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

Handled missing values and outliers.

Renamed and standardized columns for clarity.

Removed duplicate records and inconsistencies.

Converted data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical columns).

Performed feature engineering to prepare for visualization.

📈 Data Visualization & Insights

Using Python and Power BI, several key metrics were explored:

Top-selling products and outlets

Sales by region and item type

Impact of visibility and price on sales

Monthly/Yearly sales performance trends

Customer preference patterns

Power BI dashboard provides interactive filters, charts, and KPIs for deeper business insights.
